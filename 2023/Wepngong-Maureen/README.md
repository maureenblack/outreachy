# Introduction
Hii everyone, my name is Wepngong Maureen, I am from Cameroon.
I am an outreachy intern and very excited to be participating in this project because I am passionate about building applications using Django and Wagtail.
As an intern, I will be bringing valuable skills and experience to the team, and I am excited to see what I can accomplish.
I am very passionate about making a difference in the world of technology, and I believe Wagtail can help me achieve these goals. I am interested in coding, design and documentation and wagtail has a wide range of projects that can help me develop these skills and make a meaningful impact.
Fun fact, i am not from a tech background, I studied Public administration in school and yet taught myself coding. yay.
I look forward to working with you all. :)
